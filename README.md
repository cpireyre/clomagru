# Clomagru
## This is a learning project! Adjust expectations accordingly.

The idea here is to teach myself to build a non-trivial web application in Clojure.

The feature spec is inspired by the introductory web project in the [42](https://www.42.fr/) curriculum known as Camagru. You can think of it as a [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) clone, but more bare-bones.

I know very little Clojure, and not much more about making web applications, so this project is helping me get my bearings when it comes to interacting with build tools, the library ecosystem, the language itself, the browser, the server, everything.

Stay tuned.
